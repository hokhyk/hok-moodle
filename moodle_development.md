# Moodle Functions for Roles and Capabilities  require_login() get_context_instance() require_capability()  has_capability()
There are several important functions in Moodle in the roles and capabilities system.

The first line of defense in a script is the require_login() function to restrict access to logged-in users. This function first checks that the user is logged in and then optionally checks whether they are allowed to be in a particular course and/or view a particular course module.

To check a user's permission for a capability in a certain context requires a couple of functions. The first, get_context_instance(), returns a context instance as an object. A context instance is a context level (e.g. CONTEXT_COURSE) and an instance id (e.g., a course id).

Once you have the context instance you can require a capability in a script using the function require_capability() or you can check to see if a user has a particular capability before performing some action with the function has_capability(). An application of these functions might look like this:

$context = get_context_instance(CONTEXT_COURSE, $courseid);
$require_capability('moodle/course:view', $context);
// some things that anyone with Â‘moodle/course:view can 
// do or see here
// now check for a more restrictive capability
    if (has_capability('moodle/course:update' $context) {
    // do some update to the course
    } else {
        error('You do not have the correct permissions');
}

# Requirements Document Structure

A software requirements document should not delve into implementation details. That is, the document should focus on what the application should do and not how it accomplishes those tasks. This provides for flexibility in implementation while still delivering solid expectations of what the functionality the program will provide.

Application Overview.The Applications overview should be completed as a collaborative effort between the programmer, user and project manager.
Objectives & Justifications
Explain why this project is being developed.
Explain the need for the program or project.
Explain why this is being done now rather than later.
Business Process
Explain the business processes that drive the need for this application.
Explain how the existing business process will change.
Explain any other systems or processes that this application will be dependent upon.
User Roles and responsibilities
Describe unique responsibilities and interactions each user/role in Moodle will have to perform once the project is complete. For example a site administrator will have to configure settings or a student is able to do certain things.
For the most part the general roles that need to be defined are student, faculty/teacher and administrator.
Interactions with Other Systems
Explain how the system will interact with other systems. For example Moodle will generate an excel file for a student system to use to upload grades
Define interactions with any and all external systems.
Replacement of Legacy Systems
Explain any legacy systems that this is going to replace
Production Rollout Considerations
Explain any considerations that will need to be taken into account when this application goes into production.
Terminology
Define any terminology that a user might not completely understand
Define all acronyms used within the requirements document or in later communications about the project between users and developers.

Functional Requirements.Functional requirements can be filled out by the project manager and programmer with the aid of the user, but should always be informed by the Application overview. This area of the requirements document is most important to the programmer because it details all the information that is specific to implementing the program.
Statement of functionality
Clearly state the required functionality of the program. Be careful to state exactly what is required; no more and no less. This will be a loosely binding contract between the customer and the development team.
In general for Moodle development you will want to break down the functional requirements based on user roles. If your program is more of a system-wide core feature then it may be better to list the requirements based on function.
Security considerations
Explain any security issues that may need to be addressed as part of your application.
Explain what actions specific users will be allowed to do or what actions they specifically cannot do.
Customization issues
List any specific customization considerations that may need to be addressed as part of application deployment. Specifically address what customizations (if any) the user will need to accomplish.
Reports
Describe any reports, logging, or system overview that the application will need to provide.
Performance Requirements
List any specific performance requirements here. There must be specific metrics and acceptable values listed, no vague or ambiguous statements.
Usability
List any specific usability considerations or requirements here.
Scope
List each of the requirements in the Statement of function requirements and in which phase of the project they are to be completed by.
Generally use a phased approach to list out each set of functional requirements that will be used.
Note when a feature or phase is optional.
Supplementary/Background Information/Appendixes. List any supplementary documents, references or background information that may be necessary to understand, implement, test, or use the application.
